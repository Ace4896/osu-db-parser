# osu-db-parser

A small library for parsing osu! database files. It is capable of parsing:

- `osu.db` - Information about all installed beatmaps
- `collections.db` - Information about beatmap collections
- `scores.db` - Information scores achieved locally

The formats for each database are described in more detail on the [osu! wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu/wiki/Legacy-database-file-structure).
